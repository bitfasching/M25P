# M25P Library for Arduino

Add memory to your Arduino projects by connecting an external flash memory IC via SPI. I found this useful for playing back sound and buffering larger amounts of data before sending them to a host computer.

Note that this is code from 2015 and the [M25P](https://media-www.micron.com/-/media/client/global/documents/products/data-sheet/nor-flash/serial-nor/m25p/m25p16.pdf) by Micron has reached end of life. However, I suspect that pin-compatible [SST25VF](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20005044C.pdf) family by Microchip might be a drop-in replacement. If you enjoy comparing datasheets or have a SST25VF chip to test, let me know. ;)
